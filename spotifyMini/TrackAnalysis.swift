    let instrumentalness: Float
    // "Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0."

    let speechiness: Float
    // Basically the opposite of instrumentalness. "... Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks."

    let liveness: Float
    // "Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live."

    let timeSignature: Int // isnt a true time signature. "An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure)."
